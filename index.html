						Beating the bounds is an ancient English custom where by younger members of the community are escorted around the boundaries to help share knowledge of where they lay. 

						So a sort of map by memory association, children would be familiarised with the bounds of their village based upon a good old beating at the boundary

						Rest assured I'll refrain from the beating today as we visit the markers around the boundaries of GIS

						So in our journey around the bounds we're going to visit three markers: Search, Change and Mapping. At each marker I'll ask the questions:

						What does our traditional view of the marker look like?
						What is disrupting the marker?

						....and finally

					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						1. What does the traditional view look like?
						Our traditional way of searching has focussed on searching the data sources that underpin our maps.But what if we think about it differently. What is we ask ourselves the question what's the best environment to put our data into to make it easier to search our data. Where would we look?
						Imagine if everything on our maps was searchable?
						Our exacting nature means we believe our audiences want exact results
						Most spatial search seems to begin by you knowing what you want to search for!

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting
						Elasticsearch is a document orientated search engine based upon the Apache Lucence project. It supports both unstructured and structured search and importantly does so in near real time!

						By using elasticsearch we're able to meet the expectations of our user base, we're enabling search in our applications which matches the search experience they encounter elsewhere on the internet.

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting....

						However being able to combine free text search with geo location is the crucial next step for our applications

						Elasticsearch now includes support for spatial datatypes. Not only can we ask for information based upon an attribute of that information, but we can ask for information based upon where it exists.

						Now you could argue - this is not really disruptive, we've been searching for things spatially for years, yes, but....

					<aside class="notes">
						3. What might the future look like

						Well I know those in the old guard might be thinking to themselves....you'll not get rid of those spatial databases. However the future is no longer neatly locked into a single stack of technology.

						The future involves more and more data! And as the volume of our data increases we need better ways to search it. 

						We need to understand what tools best fit our requirements. We're backing search technology, not GIS technology when it comes to searching!

						1. What does the traditional view look like?
						
						We work with alot of organisations which want to know what's changed, when and by who. However this sort of requirement has traditionally been met by big expensive solutions.

						In my first job as a GIS Analyst we used to 'Merge and Post' overnight a long drawn out reconciliation of changes made across all the GIS editors in the organisation.

						These version management solutions have remained the realm of those with deep pockets, and the rest of us have just cobbled along...until.

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting
						
						Software engineers had been using this thing called version control for quite some time to manage source code. Multiple people could edit source code files at the same time and a system would track all these changes as well as provide ways to manage conflict resolution where conflicting changes occurred to the same file.

						This sounds like something we could benefit from...

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting....
						
						Over the last 5 years Git has emerged as the version control system of choice. 

						Not only has it become popular amongst the IT world - it has become a growing platform for collaboration across non-it professionals. The City of Chicago for example has released a series of data openly via GitHub.

						But how is this brave new world effecting our traditional world and how might it help us?

						Well, companies like GitHub are now able to store and version control certain types of spatial data. In the example behind me you can see how you can visualise changes in geojson data committed to github.
