						I want to spend the next 20 minutes or so exploring the boundaries where GIS and IT converge.

						At Geoplex we often operate where these lines are blurred and I'd like to share with you today an insight into some technology which is straying into the GIS domain - in effect highlighting a geekification of GIS.

					<aside class="notes">
						Beating the bounds is an ancient English custom where by younger members of the community are escorted around the boundaries to help share knowledge of where they lay. 

						So a sort of map by memory association, children would be familiarised with the bounds of their village based upon a good old beating at the boundary

						Rest assured I'll refrain from the beating today as we visit the markers around the boundaries of GIS

					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
						So in our journey around the bounds we're going to visit three markers: Search, Change and Mapping. These markers represent three constants of GIS implementation.

						At each marker I'll ask the questions:

						What does our traditional view of the marker look like?
						What is disrupting the marker?

						....and finally

						What might the future look like>

						1. What does the traditional view look like?

						It's quite ironic that Maps are meant to help us find things more easily. The current landscape of GIS applications and 'spatial data catalogues' fail miserably at providing useful search capabilities. They remind me of reading Where's Wally books to my kids.......frustrating.

						Imagine if everything on our maps was searchable?

					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						1. What does the traditional view look like?

						Our traditional way of searching has focussed on searching the data sources that underpin our maps.But what if we think about it differently. What is we ask ourselves the question what's the best environment to put our data into to make it easier to search our data. Where would we look?


						Our exacting nature means we believe our audiences want exact results

						Most spatial search seems to begin by assuming the audient knows what they want to search for!

						Are we using the right tool for the job?

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting

						Over the past year at Geoplex we've been using Elasticsearch to support search requirements

						Elasticsearch is a document orientated search engine based upon the Apache Lucence project. It supports both unstructured and structured search and importantly does so in near real time!

						By using elasticsearch we're able to meet the expectations of our user base, we're enabling search in our applications which matches the search experience they encounter elsewhere on the internet.

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting....

						Furthermore

						Being able to combine free text search with geo location is the crucial next step for our applications

						Elasticsearch now includes support for spatial datatypes. Not only can we ask for information based upon an attribute of that information, but we can ask for information based upon where it exists.

						Now you could argue - this is not really disruptive, we've been searching for things spatially for years, yes but our executions have not been targeting our audiences expectations.

					<aside class="notes">
						3. What might the future look like

						Well I know those in the old guard might be thinking to themselves....you'll not get rid of those spatial databases. However the future is no longer neatly locked into a single stack of technology.

						The future involves more and more data! And as the volume of our data increases we need better ways to search it. 

						We need to understand what tools best fit our requirements. We're backing search technology, not GIS technology when it comes to searching!

						1. What does the traditional view look like?
						
						We work with alot of organisations which want to know what's changed, when and by who. However this sort of requirement has traditionally been met by big expensive solutions.

						In my first job as a GIS Analyst we used to 'Merge and Post' overnight a long drawn out reconciliation of changes made across all the GIS editors in the organisation.

						These version management solutions have remained the realm of those with deep pockets, and the rest of us have just cobbled along...until.

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting

						So what's changing?
						
						Software engineers had been using this thing called version control for quite some time to manage source code. 

						Multiple people could edit source code files at the same time and a system would track all these changes as well as provide ways to manage conflict resolution where conflicting changes occurred to the same file.

						This sounds like something we could benefit from...

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting....
						
						Over the last 5 years Git has emerged as the version control system of choice. 

						Not only has it become popular amongst the IT world - it has become a growing platform for collaboration across non-it professionals. The City of Chicago for example has released a series of data openly via GitHub.

						But how is this brave new world effecting our traditional world and how might it help us?

						Well, companies like GitHub are now able to store and version control certain types of spatial data. In the example behind me you can see how you can visualise changes in geojson data committed to github.

					<aside class="notes">
						3. What might the future look like
						
						GeoJson and Github might be just the first step on our journey towards a brighter future where we can have manage change in our spatial data more easily and cost effectively.

						I think one of the most exciting projects in this space is the GeoGit project being spearheaded by Boundless. 

						Boundless have essentially created a branch of Git which allows you to commit a wider range of spatial data formats, such as Shapefile, PostGIS and SQL Server. Once committed into your GeoGit repository the data is tracked at the feature level. Any committed version can be differnced and exported.

						1. What does the traditional view look like?

						It's a crowded space out there in the mapping world. Ask Rohan :)

						Surely everything has been done, we have static maps, dynamic maps, slippy maps, a million map API's, we have vector in the browser, we have temporal display, we have even have live twitter maps. Is there anything else left to do?

						Does the crowd mean it can't be disrupted? Of course not, in my next example we'll see a disruption which is targetted towards combining together three factors which have been arguably absent until recently

						These three factors are: Cost, Ease, Power

					<h2>CartoDB</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						2. What is disrupting

						CartoDB has packaged the power of PostGIS into an interface where you can easily load spatial data and create powerful visualisations within a few clicks, and importantly they are doing so at a price point which disrupts the traditional model.

						3. What might the future look like



						So before we conclude our journey around the boundaries of GIS, lets just briefly ask the question:

						Why are the boundaries of GIS being blurred? Well I think there are two key reasons:

					</aside>
				</section>
				<section  data-background="http://mapbutcher.github.io/geekification-gis/img/native.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">

					The first reason is the ever increasing population of digitial natives. It is arguably the combination of digital natives with an entrepreneurial appetite which is leading to innovation in our industry and I for one think this is a really positive thing.
					
						
					</aside>
				</section>		
				<section  data-background="http://mapbutcher.github.io/geekification-gis/img/foss.png">
					<aside class="notes">

					The second reason is the maturity of open source technology as an enabler - in each of the examples given this afternoon, open source has played a vital role. Elasticsearch wouldn't exist without Lucene, Github without Git and finally CartoDB without PostGIS and Mapnik. 

					A closed proprietary eco-system is not devoid of innovation, but the geekification of GIS is flourishing under the influence of open source.
